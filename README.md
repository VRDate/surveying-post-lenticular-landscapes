# Surveying post-lenticular landscapes
A workshop by Apt Opt Out.

Here's a list of resources for developing projects with the Kinect. If people miss certain information or have more resources let me know. With this document I hope everyone can find a place to start for making projects with the Kinect.

In the folder [processing](https://github.com/aptoptout/surveying-post-lenticular-landscapes/tree/master/processing) you can find several examples I have prepared and were developed during the workshop.

From Monday, January 28th 2019, there are 2 available MS Kinect's in Hacklab at the Royal Academy of Art. [Here](https://www.gooxbox360.nl/xbox-360-accessoires-kopen/microsoft-kinect/) is a good place to buy secondhand Kinect's where they are first tested before being sold.

## Kinect + Processing
In this section I'll link to lots of resources for creating projects with the Kinect and Processing.

There are some general resources in there which focus more on learning Processing, writing Object Oriented Programming or working with vectors. Intentionally I've included such resources here as well since those will help you with any Kinect project as well.

## Kinect + Unity
In this section I'll link to lots of resources for developing projects with the Kinect and Unity. However I'm actually exploring this topic still myself so this will be updated over time.

If you have resources that would fit this section please let me know.

1. Install MacPorts [↗](https://www.macports.org/install.php)
2. Install OpenNI via this installer [↗](https://storage.googleapis.com/goog...ple-openni/OpenNI_NITE_Installer-OSX-0.24.zip)
3. Download Unity-OpenNI Bindings [↗](https://web.archive.org/web/20170607225336/http://zigfu.com/en/downloads/legacy/)

## Kinect vanilla (advanced)
To fully get the power of the Kinect you can install all drivers and middleware that will allow you to use everything the Kinect contains (including the microphone array for example).

Start with this installation process: http://developkinect.com/resource/mac-os-x/install-openni-nite-and-sensorkinect-mac-os-x
